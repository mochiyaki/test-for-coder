# test-for-coder

A small collection of simple web examples created for experimenting with the Coder terminal AI.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `color_picker.html` | Demo page with a single button that changes the page background to a random color. |
| `tic_tac_toe.html` | A fully‑functional implementation of Tic‑Tac‑Toe using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. |
| `pong.html` | A classic Pong game written in plain JavaScript. |

## How to Run

Because they are plain HTML files you can simply open them in a browser:

```bash
# Windows
start color_picker.html
start tic_tac_toe.html
start pong.html
```

or double‑click them in Explorer. No server or build step is required.

## Extending

Feel free to add more examples or convert the existing ones into a single page. The scripts are written to be self‑contained.
